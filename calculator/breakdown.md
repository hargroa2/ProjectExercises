# Calculator: HTML, CSS, JS

This calculator has a setup using several structures and techniques:

## HTML & CSS

- div container -> div calculator -> calculator display, calculator keys
- Inside of the calculator keys div, there are 17 buttons which all have individual classes for grid area locations (grid-template-areas and grid-area: name) and then have either two classes, operator and number, for background colors.
- The calculator display is just a box with fixed width and padding with the zero inside text-aligned to the right

## JS
